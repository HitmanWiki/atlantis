                  Atlantis Coin ($LOST) is a tribute to the countless treasures lost in the crypto world—rugged
                  projects, abandoned wallets, misplaced tokens, and forgotten fortunes. Just as the legend of Atlantis
                  speaks of a magnificent city swallowed by the sea, $LOST symbolizes the countless digital assets that
                  have vanished into blockchain history, whether through human error, scams, or the relentless evolution
                  of the market.

                  Yet, the myth of Atlantis is not just about loss; it’s about the hope of rediscovery, the idea that
                  beneath the waves, lost riches still lie in wait. $LOST embodies this eternal hope, representing
                  resilience, mystery, and the belief that what has disappeared can still be found. It is a token of
                  second chances, a reminder that even in the chaos of the crypto space, fortune favors those who refuse
                  to stop searching.

                  Whether it’s traders chasing new opportunities, developers reviving abandoned innovations, or
                  investors waiting for long-lost projects to rise again, Atlantis Coin stands as a symbol that the
                  blockchain is full of hidden paths and buried treasures, ready to be uncovered by those bold enough to
                  dive deep. With liquidity burnt, no team tokens, 0 tax, and an absolutely decentralized
                  community-driven foundation, $LOST is built with full transparency—restoring hope and trust in crypto.
